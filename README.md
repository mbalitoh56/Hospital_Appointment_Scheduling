# Hospital_Appointment_Scheduling
##Introduction

The **Hospital Appointment System** is a Java-based application designed to manage appointments in a hospital setting. It allows users to log in as either an **Admin**, **Doctor**, or **Patient**, with each role having different privileges. Patients can book appointments with doctors, while admins can cancel appointments and view all appointments. The system also supports searching for appointments by patient or doctor name. Appointments are stored in a text file, ensuring data persistence between sessions. The application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
