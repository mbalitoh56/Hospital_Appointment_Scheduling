## **Reflection**  

### **Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Choosing the Right Template**  
   - GitHub offers multiple templates like **Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, and Bug Triage**.  
   - The challenge was selecting the most suitable one for our **Hospital Appointment Scheduling System**.  
   - We chose **Automated Kanban** because it provides **built-in issue tracking and workflow automation**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Customization Difficulties**  
   - **Adding new columns:** Creating **"Testing"** and **"Blocked"** required adjusting workflows.  
   - **Managing automation:** Some tasks moved automatically, but others needed manual updates.  
   - **WIP Limit Implementation:** Unlike Jira, GitHub does not enforce WIP limits, so we had to track them manually.  

### **Comparing GitHub‚Äôs Templates to Other Tools**  
| Feature        | GitHub Projects | Trello | Jira |
|--------------|---------------|--------|------|
| **Ease of Use** | ‚úÖ Simple, but limited automation | ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop, intuitive | ‚ùå Complex, steep learning curve |
| **Automation** | ‚úÖ Some built-in automation | ‚ùå Mostly manual | ‚úÖ Advanced workflow automation |
| **Integration** | ‚úÖ Strong with GitHub | ‚úÖ Supports many third-party tools | ‚úÖ Deep integration with CI/CD |
| **Customization** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (fixed column structure) | ‚úÖ Highly flexible | ‚úÖ Advanced, but complex |
| **Best For** | **Developers using GitHub** | **Small teams, general tasks** | **Agile teams, complex projects** |

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **GitHub Projects** is best for teams already using GitHub but lacks **advanced automation**.  
- **Trello** is more **flexible and user-friendly** but has **less automation**.  
- **Jira** is the most **powerful for Agile workflows** but requires **more setup and learning**.
