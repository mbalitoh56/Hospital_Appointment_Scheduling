## Customization Choices  
- **Added "Testing" Column**: Ensures features are verified by QA before moving to "Done".  
- **Added "Blocked" Column**: Highlights tasks that are stalled due to dependencies.  
- **Linked GitHub Issues**: Tracks progress of key features (`feature`) and bug fixes (`bug`).  
- **Task Assignments**: Uses `@mentions` to distribute work among team members.


# **Kanban Board Explanation**  

A **Kanban board** is a visual tool used to track tasks as they move through different stages of a workflow. It helps teams manage work efficiently by displaying tasks in columns that represent their progress (e.g., *To Do, In Progress, Done*).  

### **How Our Kanban Board Works**  

**Visualizing Workflow**  
- Each column represents a stage in the development process:  
- *To Do* – Tasks that need to be started.  
- *In Progress* – Tasks currently being worked on.  
- *Testing* – Tasks waiting for quality checks.  
- *Blocked* – Tasks that are stalled due to dependencies.  
- *Done* – Completed tasks.  
- Team members can see which tasks are active, pending, or completed at a glance.  

**Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)**  
- To avoid overload, we limit **WIP** to a maximum of **3 tasks per column** (except "Blocked").  
- This prevents multitasking, reduces bottlenecks, and ensures smooth task progression.  

**Supporting Agile Principles**  
- The board enables **continuous delivery** by allowing tasks to flow through stages efficiently.  
- **Adaptability** is improved as team members can quickly adjust priorities based on sprint needs.  
- Issues and features are categorized (`feature`, `bug`), ensuring structured and iterative improvements.
