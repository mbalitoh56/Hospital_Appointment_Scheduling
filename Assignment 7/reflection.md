### **Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template**

**Choosing the Right Template**

- GitHub offers multiple templates like **Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, and Bug Triage**.  
- The challenge was selecting the most suitable one for our **Hospital Appointment Scheduling System**.  
- We chose **Automated Kanban** because it provides **built-in issue tracking and workflow automation**.  

**Customization Difficulties**  

- **Adding new columns:** Creating **"Testing"** and **"Blocked"** required adjusting workflows.  
- **Managing automation:** Some tasks moved automatically, but others needed manual updates.  
- **WIP Limit Implementation:** Unlike Jira, GitHub does not enforce WIP limits, so we had to track them manually.  

### **Comparing GitHub’s Templates to Other Tools**

| Feature        | GitHub Projects | Trello | Jira |
|--------------|---------------|--------|------|
| **Ease of Use** | ✅ Simple, but limited automation | ✅ Drag-and-drop, intuitive | ❌ Complex, steep learning curve |
| **Automation** | ✅ Some built-in automation | ❌ Mostly manual | ✅ Advanced workflow automation |
| **Integration** | ✅ Strong with GitHub | ✅ Supports many third-party tools | ✅ Deep integration with CI/CD |
| **Customization** | ⚠️ Limited (fixed column structure) | ✅ Highly flexible | ✅ Advanced, but complex |
| **Best For** | **Developers using GitHub** | **Small teams, general tasks** | **Agile teams, complex projects** |

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **GitHub Projects** is best for teams already using GitHub but lacks **advanced automation**.  
- **Trello** is more **flexible and user-friendly** but has **less automation**.  
- **Jira** is the most **powerful for Agile workflows** but requires **more setup and learning**.
