# Reflection: Challenges in Meeting Stakeholder Needs

Creating a hospital appointment system was not easy because different people had different needs. Patients, doctors, hospital staff, IT teams, and insurance companies all had their own expectations, and sometimes these needs are conflicted.

**Different Priorities** – Patients wanted an easy way to book appointments, but doctors needed a well-organized schedule. Administrators wanted less paperwork. If I focused too much on one group, it could have caused problems for another. For example, allowing patients to reschedule freely could make doctors' schedules messy.

**Technology vs. User Expectations** – People wanted a system that was simple and fast, but IT staff had to make sure it was safe and reliable. Some features, like real-time scheduling, needed complex technology, which made the system harder to maintain.

**Overbooking and Cancellations** – Doctors didn’t want last-minute cancellations, but patients wanted flexibility. The system needed reminders to reduce missed appointments while still allowing changes when needed.

**Data Security** – The system had to protect patient information while still letting insurance companies verify details. The challenge was making sure only the right people could access sensitive data.

**Easy to Use for Everyone** – Some users, like doctors and administrators, needed advanced tools, while patients and receptionists needed something simple. The system had to work well for both technical and non-technical users.

**Handling Growth** – The hospital wanted a system that could handle more patients in the future. IT staff had to make sure it didn’t slow down when many people used it at the same time.

### Conclusion
To balance everyone’s needs, I had to listen to all users and find a fair solution. Adding features like reminders, role-based access, and an easy-to-use design helped make sure the system worked well for everyone.
