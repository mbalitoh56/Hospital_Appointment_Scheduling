To complete this task, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Project using the Selected Template**  
1. Navigate to your **GitHub repository** for the **Hospital Appointment Scheduling System**.  
2. Click on **Projects** > **New Project**.  
3. Select the **Automated Kanban** template (chosen in the previous task).  
4. Name the project (e.g., *Hospital Appointment Scheduling Board*).  

### **Step 2: Customize the Kanban Board**  
1. Click **Edit Project** > **Customize Board**.  
2. Add two new columns:  
   - **"Testing"** ‚Äì To track completed development tasks awaiting QA.  
   - **"Blocked"** ‚Äì To highlight tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies.  

### **Step 3: Populate the Board with Tasks**  
1. Add tasks based on your **previous sprint plan (Assignment 6)**.  
2. Create **GitHub Issues** for each user story (e.g., *"Implement Doctor Availability Check"*).  
3. Assign relevant **labels** to issues:  
   - üü¢ `feature` ‚Äì For new system functionalities.  
   - üî¥ `bug` ‚Äì For fixing reported issues.  
4. Link the **GitHub Issues** to the Kanban board by selecting **"Add Cards"** and pasting the issue URLs.  

### **Step 4: Assign Tasks**  
1. Use `@mentions` to assign tasks to **team members** (e.g., `@JohnDoe` for implementing authentication).  
2. Move tasks between columns as they progress.

## **Deliverables**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Screenshot of Kanban Board**  
   - Show custom columns (`Testing`, `Blocked`).  
   - Show linked GitHub Issues with labels (`feature`, `bug`).  
   - Show task assignments with `@mentions`.

```markdown
# Hospital Appointment Scheduling Board

## Customization Choices  
- **Added "Testing" Column**: Ensures features are verified by QA before moving to "Done".  
- **Added "Blocked" Column**: Highlights tasks that are stalled due to dependencies.  
- **Linked GitHub Issues**: Tracks progress of key features (`feature`) and bug fixes (`bug`).  
- **Task Assignments**: Uses `@mentions` to distribute work among team members.  

This setup improves project visibility, aligns with Agile principles, and streamlines sprint tracking.
