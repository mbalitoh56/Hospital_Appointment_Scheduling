# TAGS ISSUES for CONTRIBUTORS




## Navigating Labeled Issues

Welcome to the Hospital Appointment Scheduling System project! This guide will help you find and understand issues labeled for contribution.

## üîç Finding Labeled Issues

To discover issues by label:

1. **Navigate to the Issues Tab**:

   * Go to the repository's main page.
   * Click on the **"Issues"** tab.

2. **Filter by Labels**:

   * On the right sidebar, locate the **"Labels"** section.
   * Click on a label (e.g., `good first issue` or `feature-request`) to filter issues accordingly.

3. **Use the Search Bar**:

   * At the top of the Issues page, use the search bar to input queries like:

     * `is:issue is:open label:"good first issue"`
     * `is:issue is:open label:"feature-request"`

   * To filter issues that have both labels:

     * `is:issue is:open label:"good first issue" label:"feature-request"`

   * To filter issues that have either label:

     * `is:issue is:open label:"good first issue","feature-request"`

   *Note*: Using a comma between labels applies a logical OR, while separating labels with spaces applies a logical AND.&#x20;
