# Introduction

## Project Title:
Hospital Appointment System

## Domain:
Healthcare

The **Hospital Appointment System** is part of the **Healthcare** field, which focuses on providing medical services and managing things like patient visits, doctor appointments, and hospital operations. This system is designed to help patients book appointments with doctors, let admins manage and cancel appointments, and make sure doctors can see their own schedules. It makes the process of managing appointments smoother and more organized, which helps improve the patient experience and hospital efficiency.

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this **Hospital Appointment System** is to solve problems that hospitals face with scheduling and managing appointments. In many hospitals, it's easy to have double-booked appointments, missed appointments, or patients struggling to find available doctors. This system helps by allowing patients to book appointments directly with doctors, giving admins the ability to manage and cancel appointments, and allowing doctors to view their own appointments. The system also stores appointment data so that information is saved even after closing the program. By making appointments more organized, the system helps hospitals run more smoothly and makes it easier for patients to access care.

## Individual Scope:
The Hospital Appointment System is a practical and useful solution to the problems that hospitals face with scheduling. The system will allow:

**Patients** to book, view, and search for their appointments.

**Doctors** to manage and see their own schedules.

**Admins** to manage all appointments and cancel them if needed.

This system is built using Java Swing, which makes it easy to use on desktop computers. It saves appointment data in text files, which is simple but works well for this type of system. The system also includes different user roles (Admin, Doctor, Patient) to make sure only the right people can access certain parts of the system.

This system is easy to make and can be done with small teams or limited resources. The main features are simple and easy to maintain, making it a great fit for a small-scale healthcare setting.The Hospital Appointment System is feasible and valuable in addressing the inefficiencies commonly seen in hospitals regarding appointment scheduling.
