## **Kanban Board Explanation**  

A **Kanban board** is a visual tool used to track tasks as they move through different stages of a workflow. It helps teams manage work efficiently by displaying tasks in columns that represent their progress (e.g., *To Do, In Progress, Done*).  

### **How Our Kanban Board Works**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualizing Workflow**  
   - Each column represents a stage in the development process:  
     - *To Do* ‚Äì Tasks that need to be started.  
     - *In Progress* ‚Äì Tasks currently being worked on.  
     - *Testing* ‚Äì Tasks waiting for quality checks.  
     - *Blocked* ‚Äì Tasks that are stalled due to dependencies.  
     - *Done* ‚Äì Completed tasks.  
   - Team members can see which tasks are active, pending, or completed at a glance.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)**  
   - To avoid overload, we limit **WIP** to a maximum of **3 tasks per column** (except "Blocked").  
   - This prevents multitasking, reduces bottlenecks, and ensures smooth task progression.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Supporting Agile Principles**  
   - The board enables **continuous delivery** by allowing tasks to flow through stages efficiently.  
   - **Adaptability** is improved as team members can quickly adjust priorities based on sprint needs.  
   - Issues and features are categorized (`feature`, `bug`), ensuring structured and iterative improvements.  

This approach keeps our **Hospital Appointment Scheduling System** project **organized, efficient, and Agile-friendly**. üöÄ
